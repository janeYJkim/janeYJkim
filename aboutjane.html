        <div class="content-body">
           <p>I was born in 1995 in Seoul, Korea and I spent most of my school years in a small town in California. 
               I studied English for International Communication and Conferences (EICC) in Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
               I am currently working as an English Interpreter and Translator in Corporate Citizenship Office of Samsung Electronics.
           </p>
           <p> I spend most of my free time designing a website (like this one!) or cuddle with my cutest poodle. Her name is CoCo and I love her so much. She's the cutest thing.
