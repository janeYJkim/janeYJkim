          <p> I was born in 1995 in Seoul, Korea and I spent most of my school years in a small town in California. I studied English for International Communication and Conferences (EICC) in Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. I have extensive experience in English translation and interpretation as you can see in the experience folder of this website! Currently, I am working as an English Interpreter and Translator in Corporate Citizenship Office of Samsung Electronics and I love my job so far!</p> 
          <p> I self-taught myself HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JavaScript and I spend most of my free time designing a website (like this one!). </p>
